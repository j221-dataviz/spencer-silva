<p><em>More home runs were hit in 2017 than any other season in MLB history. Some of the game’s most well-respected observers are convinced it has something to do with the ball. 
</em></p>

<p><em>The Ringer’s MLB correspondent Ben Lindbergh has spent a lot of time <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/6/14/16044264/2017-mlb-home-run-spike-juiced-ball-testing-reveal-155cd21108bc">looking into the issue</a>. He’ll chime in now and again to help us understand what’s going on.</em></p>

<h4>Birth of a record</h4>

<p>With almost two weeks left to in the season, Alex Gordon of the Kansas City Royals hit the <strong>5,694th</strong> home run of the summer — a new record. By season’s end, that total swelled to <strong>6,105</strong>, more than 400 home runs above the previous high. And it didn’t stop there. The 2017 postseason also saw a spate of new home run records, for both single-game and team output. Meanwhile, viewership and fan engagement were high as ever. </p>

<p>A few short seasons ago, that wasn’t the case. In fact, in 2014, after several years of diminished scoring throughout the game, league commissioner Rob Manfred publicly considered measures that would increase scoring. He flirted with lowering the pitcher’s mound or banning certain defense practices, like the shift, that limit scoring — and thus, entertainment. </p>

<p>Now those changes would be moot. To get a better sense of the new home run landscape, let's peek at the data.</p>

<p>One explanation that’s gained traction in the baseball world is that something is materially different about the baseball. The ball is juiced, observers say, though the league office denies as much. </p>

<p>The previous league-wide home run record was set in 2000, in the midst of what’s commonly referred to as the “<strong>Steroid Era.</strong>” Baseball’s most notable sluggers at the time — Mark McGwire, Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa — were all using anabolic steroids to increase their strength, endurance and home run totals. The widespread use of the drugs during that era is the accepted explanation for the barrage of dingers. </p>

<p>Starting in 2006, however, the MLB adopted strict drug-testing guidelines and banned a number of new substances. The implementation of the new drug policy, along with innovations in defense and pitching correlated with a downturn in home runs hit in subsequent seasons. It stayed that way until 2015, when the amount of home runs per batted ball began to <sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> soar, which led to speculation about material changes in the game. </p>

<p>The chart above shows how the past two seasons have eclipsed the home run rates from even the Steroid Era. </p>

<p>Some have suggested that Performance Enhancing Drugs (PEDs) are reentering the sport, but Lindbergh, of the Ringer, and others say the league-wide rise in home runs — at such a rapid rate — indicates that steroids are unlikely to be the culprit. As one minor league player player joked to me, “It’s not like there was a group text that went out one day saying ‘hey, boys, swing for the fences.’"</p>

<h4>“Democratization” of the long ball</h4>

<p>The violin-jitter plot above bears out that explanation. Over the past two seasons, you can see that, unlike the 1990s, more players' home run totals are clustered around the center.</p>

<p>In today's game, more players hit between 10 and 30 home runs per season. <sup><a id="ffn2" href="#fn2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> The widespread home run bump to all players suggests a material change in the equipment, i.e. the ball, is afoot — not steroids. </p>

<p>Visualized a different way: </p>

<figure><img src="hrbins_2010.png"/></figure>

<p>Pay close attention to the intersecting lines over the past two seasons. The “0-10” and “21-30” bins have moved in opposite directions. Fewer and fewer players in the MLB are hitting less than 10 home runs per season. </p>
