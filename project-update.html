<h2>Data Viz Update </h2>

<h2>11 • 09 • 2017 </h2>

<p>Hi Peter,</p>

<p>Here is a look at the graphs I’ve made so far:</p>

<p>I want to animate the histogram above, like you suggested, from 1995 to 2017. The challenge is to show the change in distribution over time in a meaningful way. Is it possible to superimpose the total number of home runs hit on a chart like this? That would help illustrate the peaks and valleys of home run output in relation to the distribution. </p>

<p>Here is a select from the above chart, but only the 2017 season. I set the binwidth for this histogram at “1”:</p>

<p>• <strong>Note:</strong> I couldn’t figure out how to make the striped histogram you suggested, where one bar would show for each bin. Right now it shows the home run frequency of each seasonal outcome. </p>

<p>The line chart below isn’t publishable, but it shows well the oddity of the 2016 and 2017 seasons. On the far right, you can really see the “0-10” fall off a cliff, while the “11-20”, “21-30” and “31-40” frequencies spike dramatically starting in 2015, when the baseball supposedly changed. </p>

<p>• <strong>Note: </strong>I need to look closer at the data and figure out why the “11-20 HR” bin is missing for 2013 and 2015. </p>

<p>Here are the two ridgeplots we’ve been working on:</p>

<p>One of my main objectives right now is to figure out a way to highlight the differences between the last few years and baseball’s steroid era—which lasted from about 1995-2005. </p>

<p>Last week, we spoke about using gganimate. However, I’m having trouble getting it to work. I think you said I may have to install software on my computer to use it. </p>

<p>Let me know when you’re available for a skype appointment next week. </p>
