<h1>DID THE MLB “JUICE” ITS BASEBALLS? </h1>

<h5>There were more home runs hit league-wide in Major League Baseball during the 2017 season than ever before. Some of baseball’s most prominent thinkers are convinced it has something to do with a change in the ball itself. </h5>

<p>One of those thinkers is Ben Lindbergh, who has written extensively about the issue for <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2017/6/14/16044264/2017-mlb-home-run-spike-juiced-ball-testing-reveal-155cd21108bc">The Ringer</a>. He’ll chime in now and again to help us understand the graphs below. </p>

<p>With almost two weeks left to go in the regular season, Alex Gordon of the Kansas City Royals hit the <strong>5,694th</strong> home run of the 2017 MLB season, a new record. By season’s end, the league-wide total swelled to <strong>6,105</strong>. That total smashed the previous record by more than 400 home runs. Meanwhile, viewership and fan engagement also rose dramatically. </p>

<p>One explanation that’s gained traction over the past year is that something is materially different about the baseball. That the ball is juiced. The league denies as much, but the evidence is convincing.</p>

<p>The last home run record was set in 2000, in the midst of what’s commonly referred to as the “<strong>Steroid Era,</strong>” when anabolic steroids were in widespread use throughout the sport. Starting in 2006, however, the MLB adopted strict testing guidelines. The implementation of the new drug policy, along with innovations in defense and pitching correlated with a downtick in the amount of home runs hit in subsequent years. Then, in 2015, the amount of home runs per batted ball<sup><a id="ffn1" href="#fn1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> soared, which led to speculation about material changes in the game. </p>

<p>Some have suggested that Performance Enhancing Drugs (PEDs) may be reentering the sport, but Lindbergh and others say the league-wide rise in home runs — at such a rapid rate — suggests that steroid use is unlikely to be the cause of the latest surge. </p>

<p>As one minor league player player joked to me, “It’s not like there was a group text that went out one day saying ‘swing for the fences.’ ”</p>
